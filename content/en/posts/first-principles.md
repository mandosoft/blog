Last week I quit my job. Well I sort of resigned and then an hour later was told to go home and take it easy. Maybe I was just hungry. In fact, I know hunger played a part in the decision to write that email gambling all that I have in terms of financial stability. What besides being hangry could have caused such a leap in courage? 

Well, I've long been fascinated by the inherent possibilities of music to be built on top of natural [metapatterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapattern). Very recently upon reviewing my physical library, I noted how
every book, from works on Computer Science, Botany, Philosophy, and hell even Astrology, pointed to this 
fascintation. 

I once stood looking at the Jung Frau mountain range and I asked, “How do I play those mountains?” 

Every question I’ve asked since has been reducible to that in some form. And it's quite a romantic question
isn't it? One that does not fit nicely with the modern guiding principle of capitalistic utility. For that reason, I cast it aside as sacred geometry hippie sh*t.

But then a month ago I had the chance to revisit these ideas rolling around in my head for nearly a decade.
I wondered, "If there exist both geometric and recusive models for biology from axioms, and music can be produced
from axioms, how can you combine them appropriately?" 

Taken from Wikipedia this is Lindenmayer's original L-system for modelling the growth of a cyanobacteria
[Anabaena catenula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaena).
