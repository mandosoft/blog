Last week I quit my job. Well I sort of resigned and then an hour later was told to go home and take it easy. Maybe I was just hungry. In fact, I know hunger played a part in the decision to write that email gambling all that I have in terms of financial stability. What could have lead to such a leap in courage? 

Well, I've long been fascinated by the inherent possibilities of music to be built on top of natural patterns and [metapatterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapattern). I've spent my life as a mandolinist
and published research in my twenties on informational relationships in the structure of proteins [[1]](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformaticsadvances/article/2/1/vbac058/6671262). Much to my dismay, these areas of nouminous delight remained mutually disjoint. 

Very recently upon reviewing my physical library, I noted how every book, from works on Computer Science, Botany, Philosophy, and even Astrology, pointed to this kind of fascintation. I remembered looking at the Jung Frau mountain range and asking myself, “How do I play those mountains?” 

I realized every question I’ve asked since has been reducible to that in some form. And it's quite a romantic question
isn't it? One that does not fit nicely with the modern guiding principle of capitalistic utility. For that reason, I cast it aside as sacred geometry hippie sh*t.

But then a month ago I had the chance to revisit these ideas rolling around in my head for nearly a decade.
I wondered, "If there exist both geometric and recusive models for biology from axioms, and music can be produced
from axioms as well, how can you combine them appropriately?" 

If you go down this trail, you will quickly come upon the work of [Aristid Lindenmayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristid_Lindenmayer). He is best known for his foundational work in algorithmic plant development through an axiomatic system known as L-systems. 

L-systems attempt to expand the 
theoretical work of [Chomsky Grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy), which at the time were widely studied. It's easy to guess that the question Lindenmayer and others started to ask was, "Does Nature itself contain a syntax underlying growth?" This lead to a great deal of work in the 80s and 90s centered around computer graphics and the realistic rendering of plants.

Such work began with Lindenmayer's original L-system for modelling the growth of a cyanobacteria
[Anabaena catenula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaena). And it's this very model that got me thinking again...

Here it is:

    variables : A B
    constants : none
    axiom  : A
    rules  : (A → AB), (B → A)

which produces:

    n = 0 : A
    n = 1 : AB
    n = 2 : ABA
    n = 3 : ABAAB
    n = 4 : ABAABABA
    n = 5 : ABAABABAABAAB
    n = 6 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABA
    n = 7 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABAABAABABAABAAB

These simple rules can create massive strings. 

It's pretty obvious people tried (and still do try) to map this concept to music. But they all seem to suffer from being obnoxiously simple and mechanistic. Such research
has always been done in this ivory tower view of harmony, counter-point, and sound wave synthesis. None of them presume that the results should be pleasing to the ear, as the outcome they are looking for is a research publication and not a worthy artistic rendering. 

Even the earlier works by Lindenmayer and the [Prusinkiewicz Laboratory](https://algorithmicbotany.org/) appear to take a great deal of artistic license in their renderings.
I don't think this is well appreciated as nature clearly shows, there's a great deal of poetic license and randomness at hand when you walk through a forest.  

With this in mind, my insight last month - whether it's original or not - was that the domain in which natural geometric structures can occur in sound has been misunderstood. 
The syntax of music is not notes or harmony structures anymore than the growth syntax of a plant is the chloroplast. How can anything with creative feeling be obtained by focusing on notes alone?

I realized from a lifetime of playing fiddle tunes, there is typically an A part and a B part. Usually a song is AABB, or AABA. What happens within that structure is up to the artist, and often there's plenty of room for improvisation on the theme, while still being true to the underlying structure. Without the syntactic structure, the tune would be unintelligle for others. It would unravel. 

It seems obvious now and I kick myself for not seeing it many years ago when I first introduced
myself to these ideas. But I hadn't had a full enough basis of knowledge to draw from and actualize them in a meaningful way. 

My notes on this subject, as I've stated, go back almost a decade. They sit in un-indexable journals filled with sloppy cursive next to my bedside. My hope is to allow this site to be 
a research repository moving forward. One where others with intuitive interest in this subject
will have something to go off of. 

So that's really why I quit my job. To pursue this fledgling idea. And who knows, maybe I'll go back in some way. But for now, my intuition demands my fullest attention to this effort which may benefit a broader community of like-minded individuals.
