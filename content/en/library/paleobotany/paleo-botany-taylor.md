This book provides up-to-date coverage of fossil plants from Precambrian life to flowering plants, including fungi and algae. It begins with a discussion of geologic time, how organisms are preserved in the rock record, and how organisms are studied and interpreted and takes the student through all the relevant uses and interpretations of fossil plants.

Looking into Paleobotany as an analog to Algorithmic Botany, since they appear to be quite few (at least non paywalled). There isn’t much I'm looking for other than a creative repository of ideas from early plant and leaf morphologies. The idea being: Metapatterns exist in nature, and then nature allows for pseudorandom permutations. Music can work this way too. I’m looking for such algorithms I suppose…

What are the earliest morphologies of plant life on earth? Are they representationally simple? Complex things result from simple processes. In terms of what is found in the Precambrian era, it can be classified as spheres (Huroniospora), rods (Gunflintia), and tubular unbranching forms (Animikea). Gunflintia is a narrow filament composed of single row of cylindrical cells.

You can use plant skeletal descriptors as your basis. Need to look into plant skeletonization techniques tomorrow.

The Gunflint formation and the long debate about whether stromatolites is pretty interesting. Early forms of life like cyano bacteria almost seem to be multiple Huroniospora chained together:
