**Summary**
Using the definition of quasiperiodic function as a motivation, the article introduces the idea of quasiperiodic music and details the composition process of a quasiperiodic music piece, Raindrops in A minor. Discusses connections between quasiperiodic music and other works of music theory and composition that make use of aperiodic order or periodic order with large periods, such as Lindenmayer systems, Vuza canons, Messiaen's Quatuor pour la Fin du Temps, and the phase music of Steve Reich.

An interesting application to L-systems as it relates to Penrose tiling. The article suggests the two
Penrose tile shapes can make up the (A or B) formulation similiar to the original cyanobacteria
L-system. The work fails to make something aesthetically interesting by using only two notes. 

The eventually convergence into polyphony over time is interesting however.
